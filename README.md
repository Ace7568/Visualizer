## Algotithms used in these project

**Dijkstra's algorithm** - is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph

**A*Search algorithm**(weighted) - A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from                                       the other conventional algorithms 

**BFS**(unweighted) - The Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm is used to search a graph data structure for a node that meets a set of criteria. It starts at the root of the graph and                            visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level

**DFS**(unweighted) - An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the                         case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
